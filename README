This project contains the necessary files for the “Yoga postures detection and correction” collab file.  This project contains the following files:

- angle_computation.py– This file contains the helper functions for the calculation of the straight lines and angles of the posture.

- cobra.py, dog.py, warrior2.py, tree.py – These files contain posture specific angle calculations functions that uses the helper function in angle_computation.py.

- cobra, dog, warrior2, tree – Data frame that contains all the training data key-points coordination’s of each posture used for finding the K-nearest-neighbours of a given image.

- Weights.best.hdf5 – The trained fully connected model that we use for the classification of yoga postures.

- movenet_thunder.tflite – The trained movenet network.

- Crawler.py – A crawler that collects images from “Google Images” for the training data. This file isn’t necessary for the Google collab file to run, but it is still a part of the project used for the data collection part.
